# quote-generator
random quote generator

Another small project that I worked on to generate random quotes. Project uses vanilla JS and CSS. 

Notes:
##attached event listener directly to button variable

##used the same concept of a random function. instead of multiplying by a max number, multiply by the array.length

##accessing an array with bracket and dot notation combined. i.e. console.log(quotes[random].quote);

##rememebered that the border radius parameters for each corner can be determined on a single line.
